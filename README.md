# The Frontend Bible

This document contains guidelines of how frontend development should be done. Masterfully crafted frontend’s are a pain in the ass to create because everything in the frontend is a feature. No problem because we will set some ground rules to help us develop easy to understand code, simple conventions, consistency, tips & tricks, design patterns, anti patterns, … 

### The frontend club
- Rule number one of the frontend club is that you have to use Typescript. No exceptions.
- Second rule of the frontend club is that you will use Typescript. Plain Javascript is. not. allowed. ever.
- Third rule of the frontend club is that everone who doesn't use Typescript is not allowed in the frontend club.
